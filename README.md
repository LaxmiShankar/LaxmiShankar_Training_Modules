1. The command used to display the current working directory is pwd(print working directory).
2. To create a new directory in Linux, use the command mkdir (directory name). 
3. The ls command is used to list files & directories.
4. To navigate to the parent directory, use cd .. this moves you up one directory level. 
5. Use the cp (source file) (destination directory) to copy files in Linux.

Since I don't have Linux installed on my system, I used the cmd terminal instead. The big differences are that I would use the touch command to create the txt file and the cat command to display its contents.
